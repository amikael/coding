# coding

An encoding/decoding for arboitrary graphs over linear order.  

### conllenc.py

This is a "supertag encoder and decoder of dependency graphs in the CoNLL-U format".

- currently restricted to (primary) dependencies in CoNLL-U files
- converts between the HEAD column and SuperTags in MISC column or string/wrapped outputs
- succeeds depconv v.0.1 (c) 2015-2019 that was never published
- supporting also graph property annotation, codestring extraction and statistics
