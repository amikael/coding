The software related to the graph representation explained in FSMNLP 2019

### conllenc.py

This is a "supertag encoder and decoder of dependency graphs in the CoNLL-U format".

- currently restricted to (primary) dependencies in CoNLL-U files
- converts between the HEAD column and SuperTags in MISC column
- based on depconv v.0.1 (c) 2015-2019 Anssi Yli-Jyrä (and Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez)
- supporting also graph property annotation, codestring extraction and statistics

See [User's manual](http://github.com/amikael/coding/conllenc-usage.md)
